#tracing code with an example: aabe

# 1st
# a is not in set so its added

# set = ('a')

# 2nd
# left = 0
# a is in the list so a is removed from substring substring[0]

# set = ( )
#left = 1

#now since a is out of the set, it goes back to the for loop iteration to add back the a
#set = ('a')

#3rd 
#set = ('a', 'b')

#4th
#set = ('a', 'b', 'e')

# now final counts
# max_length is currently 0, 
# right - left + 1 is 3 - 1 + 1 = 3

# therefore, 3 is returned

#tricky part is the window shifting, which can be handled with a while loop

#types of test cases
#mixed: aaerty
#all the same: aaaaa
#all different: gjfhs
#where one char appears in certain spots: aerat

#so the window will look for the unique bit (in case 4)

#aer is the largest window
